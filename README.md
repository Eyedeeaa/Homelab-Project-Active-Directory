### Project: Active Directory Homelab

Hey there!

This is a little project I put together to get my hands dirty with some core sysadmin stuff. It's a simple home lab that I built using a few virtual machines to practice things like Active Directory, user management, and network file sharing.

The goal here was to get a feel for how a small business or "company" network might be set up, so I could practice some real-world tasks.

#### What's in this lab?

* **1 x Windows Server 2022 VM:** This is the brains of the operation. It's running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), which is basically the central hub for managing users and computers in the network.
* **2 x Windows 11 VMs:** These are the "client" machines that are joined to the domain. They represent the employee computers in my little company.

#### What did I do?

I walked through some fundamental tasks to get the hang of things:

* **Active Directory Setup:** I set up a new domain and got the server ready to manage client machines.
* **User & Group Management:** I created a bunch of user accounts and practiced common tasks like resetting passwords. It's more fun than it sounds, I promise!
* **Group Policy Objects (GPOs):** This was a big one. I created GPOs to control settings for the users, so I could see how centralized management works. It's a super powerful tool.
* **Network Drive Sharing:** I set up shared folders on the server and mapped them as network drives for the client machines. This is a classic IT task, and it's super satisfying when it just works!

This project was a great way to learn a lot of core concepts that are crucial in the IT world. I'll probably add more features to the lab in the future, like playing around with more advanced GPOs or maybe even setting up a DNS server.

If you have any questions or just want to chat about it, feel free to reach out!
